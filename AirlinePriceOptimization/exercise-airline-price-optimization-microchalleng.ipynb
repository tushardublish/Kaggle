This notebook already includes a very simple version of `pricing_function`.  You will modify `pricing_function` to maximize the total revenue collected for all flights in our simulated environment.\n\nFor each flight, `pricing_function` will be run once per (simulated) day to set that day's ticket price. The seats you don't sell today will be available to sell tomorrow, unless the flight leaves that day.\n\nYour `pricing_function` is run for one flight at a time, and it takes following inputs:\n- **Number of days until the flight**\n- **Number of seats they have left to sell**\n- **A variable called `demand_level` that determines how many tickets you can sell at any given price. **\n\nThe quantity you sell at any price is:\n> quantity_sold = demand_level - price\n\nTicket quantities are capped at the number of seats available.\n\nYour function will output the ticket price.\n\nYou learn the `demand_level` for each day at the time you need to make predictions for that day. For all days in the future, you only know `demand_level` will be drawn from the uniform distribution between 100 and 200.  So, for any day in the future, it is equally likely to be each value between 100 and 200.\n\nIn case this is still unclear, some relevant implementation code is shown below.\n\n# The Simulator\nWe will run your pricing function in a simulator to test how well it performs on a range of flight situations.  **Run the following code cell to set up your simulation environment:**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"29b901e17dc046f84d6502c06b6933c8ae4b6f60"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import sys\nsys.path.append('../input')\nfrom flight_revenue_simulator import simulate_revenue, score_me\n","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a7b28253c46d09898ccc8908de34f38015e99bf4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In case you want to check your understanding of the simulator logic, here is a simplified version of some of the key logic (leaving out the code that prints your progress).
